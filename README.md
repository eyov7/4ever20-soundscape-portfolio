## Current Projects & Interests

### 1. Savings App Prototype
Currently developing a prototype for a personal finance application focused on savings optimization and budget tracking. This project aims to make financial planning more accessible and intuitive.

### 2. Open Source Music Citation Standard
Working on establishing an open-source standard for music citations, addressing the need for consistent attribution in digital music sharing and academic contexts. This initiative aims to bridge the gap between academic rigor and musical creativity.

### 3. Boba Business Web/Mobile Development
Actively developing web and mobile applications to support my brother's boba (bubble tea) business. This practical application of technology includes:
- Customer ordering systems
- Inventory management
- Digital menu solutions
